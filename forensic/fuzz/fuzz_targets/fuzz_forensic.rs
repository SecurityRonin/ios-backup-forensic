//! The full pipeline, entered the way a tool enters it: a directory on disk.
//!
//! The per-structure targets in `core/fuzz` each hand one parser its own bytes.
//! That misses the failures that only appear when the parsers are *composed* —
//! a plist whose `IsEncrypted` contradicts a `Manifest.db` that is not SQLite,
//! a keybag that parses but unwraps nothing, a manifest row pointing at a blob
//! that is not there. So this target builds a real backup directory and runs
//! `Backup::open` and `audit` over it.
//!
//! Both files are fuzzer-controlled, because fixing either one would leave the
//! branch that reconciles them permanently untested.
