//! When `Manifest.plist` disagrees with the bytes.
//!
//! `IsEncrypted` is a **declaration**. It tells you what the plist claims, not
//! what is true of `Manifest.db`, and the two can disagree — a hand-edited
//! plist, a partial copy, a tool that rewrote metadata without rewriting data.
//!
//! Reading the declaration and stopping there is the "an unconfigured setting
//! tells you the default, never the truth" failure: the reader would refuse a
//! perfectly readable backup, or try to parse ciphertext as SQLite, on the
//! strength of one boolean.
//!
//! So the reader surveys the **effective** state — does `Manifest.db` actually
//! begin with the SQLite magic — and recovers from the disagreement rather than
//! failing on it. Both values are kept, because the disagreement is itself
//! evidence.
//!
//! Contrast MVT, which infers encryption purely from whether `Manifest.db`
//! parses, and so cannot tell an encrypted backup from a corrupt one. Keeping
//! both signals distinguishes all three states.
