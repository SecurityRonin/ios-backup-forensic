//! Validation against a **real** iOS backup (T2 — genuine third-party artifact,
//! ground truth taken from the format spec and an independent decryptor).
//!
//! Real backups are personal evidence: they are never committed. Point
//! `IOS_BACKUP_DIR` at one to run these, e.g.
//!
//! ```text
//! IOS_BACKUP_DIR="$HOME/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/<UDID>" \
//!   cargo test -p ios-backup-core --test real_backup -- --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! Absent the variable the tests skip in ~0.00s. That near-zero duration is the
//! fingerprint of work not done — do not read a green run here as validation
//! unless the variable was set (CLAUDE.md, the three-way control).
