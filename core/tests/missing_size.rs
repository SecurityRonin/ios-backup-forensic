//! A manifest row that records no `Size`.
//!
//! Found by comparing against `datatags/mount-ios-backup`, which strips PKCS#7
//! padding and so never consults `Size` for content length. This crate
//! truncates to the recorded size (ADR-0003), which is the better default —
//! padding is not evidence and the recorded length is — but it has a failure
//! mode the padding-stripping approach does not: an **absent** size read as
//! zero truncates a real file to nothing and reports success.
//!
//! That is refusal counted as zero, and it is adversarially reachable: a
//! crafted backup that omits `Size` would make a file disappear from an
//! examiner's view while every operation reported success.
