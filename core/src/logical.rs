//! Projection of a backup as a **logical file container**.
//!
//! An iOS backup holds a captured file tree, not a block device: there is no
//! partition table and no filesystem to walk, so it belongs with AD1 and
//! AFF4-Logical rather than with EWF or VMDK. The fleet reaches those through
//! `disk_forensic::logical::open`, which lists entries and reads one by index.
//!
//! This module presents exactly that shape, so wiring a backup into the
//! abstraction is an adapter of a few lines rather than a new code path in
//! every consumer — which is the format special-casing ADR-0011 exists to
//! prevent.
//!
//! # The one thing that does not fit
//!
//! `disk_forensic::logical::open(path)` takes no credentials, so it cannot open
//! an encrypted backup. That is a gap in the abstraction rather than a quirk of
//! this format: the same function already turns away an encrypted AFF4 with
//! *"needs a password"*. [`LogicalView::open`] therefore takes [`Credentials`],
//! and ADR-0005 records the small upstream change that lets `logical::open`
//! carry them.
